# Experiments and examples

A bunch of different code notebooks of experiments and explorations. Should be `python3` with a big number of TensorFlow ones

## Experiments

- TFHub activity recognition from mp4 video.
In the example, the video of Olympic Weightlifting activity is used, a squat clean to be more precise - [link](Working_with_Video_and_tfhub_activity_recognition.ipynb)
